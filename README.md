•Designed and implemented a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not with 99% accuracy.
•Preprocessed email data by handling missing values, removing stopwords, and normalizing text through lowercasing and stemming.
•Converted text data into numerical features using CountVectorizer with a bag-of-words approach.
•Built and trained a Naive Bayes classifier, leveraging its efficiency in text classification tasks.
•Evaluated the model using performance metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
•Applied train-test split for proper validation and ensured robust evaluation of model performance.
•Conducted feature analysis to identify high-impact words contributing to spam classification.
•Integrated the model into a Django web application, allowing users to upload emails for real-time spam detection through an interactive interface.
•Deployed and tested the project in a Jupyter Notebook environment, visualizing results effectively.
•Utilized Scikit-learn for model implementation, Pandas for data manipulation, and NumPy for numerical computations.
•Designed an interactive dashboard using Django templates, displaying spam classification statistics and insights in a user-friendly format.
